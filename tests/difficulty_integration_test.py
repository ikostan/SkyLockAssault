Difficulty Integration Test (Playwright, Python)
================================================

Overview
--------
This module contains an end-to-end integration test that verifies difficulty selection
propagates correctly from the options menu into gameplay. The test automates the browser
with Playwright (sync API), drives the Godot HTML5 export via mouse/keyboard, and
asserts on console log messages emitted by the game to validate behavior.

Specifically, the test:
- Loads the game at http://localhost:8080/index.html and verifies the canvas and title.
- Opens Options, sets Log Level to DEBUG to surface detailed logs.
- Sets Difficulty to 2.0 by clicking fixed offsets relative to the game canvas
  (see tests/ui_elements_coords.py for coordinates).
- Returns to the main menu and starts the game.
- Fires the weapon and idles to allow fuel consumption.
- Asserts on expected logs for log level change, navigation, weapon cooldown scaling,
  and fuel depletion under the chosen difficulty. It also records JavaScript coverage via
  the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) as a workaround for missing Playwright Python coverage API.

Prerequisites
-------------
- A local server hosting the game at http://localhost:8080/index.html (see files/docs/Docker_Local_Test_Server.md).
- Python with pytest and Playwright installed. Example:
  - pip install pytest playwright
  - playwright install chromium
- The Godot HTML5 build should emit console logs used by this test, including:
  - "Options button pressed."
  - "Options menu loaded."
  - "Back button pressed."
  - "Start Game menu button pressed."
  - "Log level changed to: DEBUG"
  - "Difficulty changed to: 2.0"
  - "Firing with scaled cooldown: 1.0"
  - "Fuel left: <value>"

How It Works
------------
- The test uses a headless Chromium browser with flags to favor software rendering on CI
  ("--enable-unsafe-swiftshader", "--disable-gpu", "--use-gl=swiftshader").
- It creates a CDP session to start precise JavaScript coverage collection for V8, then
  listens to browser console events to gather logs for assertions.
- UI interactions use absolute coordinates calculated as: canvas bounding box origin +
  element offset from tests/ui_elements_coords.py. This makes the test resilient to
  page chrome but sensitive to layout changes inside the canvas.
- Assertions rely on the presence of specific console log messages and on a fuel
  threshold check (final fuel must be < 85.0 after idling under difficulty 2.0).

Artifacts
---------
- coverage_difficulty_integration_test.json: V8 coverage captured via CDP and saved at teardown.
- artifacts/test_difficulty_integration_failure_*.png: Screenshot on failure.
- artifacts/test_difficulty_integration_failure_console_logs.txt: Console logs on failure.

Running the Test
----------------
- Run only this test: pytest -k difficulty_integration_test -q
- Breakdown of the Command
    * `pytest`: The command to run pytest, the Python testing framework used for your Playwright
    tests (e.g., difficulty_integration_test.py).
    * `-k difficulty_integration_test`: Filters tests to run only those whose names
    (function, class, or module) contain the substring difficulty_integration_test.
    In your project, this matches the test_difficulty_integration function in
    tests/difficulty_integration_test.py, ensuring only this test runs.
    * `-q`: Short for --quiet, reduces pytestâ€™s output to minimal information, showing only a
    summary (e.g., dots for passing tests, F for failures) instead of detailed logs.
    This is useful for quick runs or CI environments where you want concise output.
- If the game loads slowly (WASM/scene init), the test includes generous waits, but you
  may extend timeouts if your environment is slower.
- For debugging, consider running the browser in headed mode by adjusting the fixture
  to headless=False.

Maintenance Notes
-----------------
- If UI layout changes, update tests/ui_elements_coords.py to match new element offsets.
- Keep asserted log strings in sync with the Godot scripts (options_menu.gd, main_menu.gd,
  weapon.gd, etc.).
- Balance changes to fuel or weapon cooldown may require adjusting thresholds or asserted
  log values.
